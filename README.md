# Boomtown üèô

Boomtown is a platform that allows users to borrow and lend items. It's a multi-view, fullstack application that uses PostgreSQL as a database, Apollo Express as a server, and React for the presentation layer. 

Built using the Boomtown Start from https://github.com/redacademy/boomtown-starter.

## Boomtown makes use of:
* Back-end:
    * PostgreSQL (Postico for GUI)
    * Apollo
    * Express
    * Node.js
    * GraphQL
* Front-end:
    * React (Router, Final Form)
    * Redux
    * Material UI

## To set up:
1. Make a Postgres database with appropriate tables
2. Download repository and run NPM install from both server and client directories
3. Run 'npm run dev:start' from server and 'npm start' from client
4. ...Ta-da!
